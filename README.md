Ozric is a modern WEB 3.0 application that can make transactions on the ethernet blockchain. It includes smart contracts and was made in React.js with lots of :sparkling_heart:. Website is currently live and is running on the GOERLI Ethernet test server.

## Description

Ozric uses Hardhat to send transactions through the Blockchain and Alchemy to provide services like analytics, monitoring, alerting, logging and debugging with crypto crypto currencies. You are required to login in to a MetaMask wallet to send any funds or view your transactions.

Ozric also allows the user to view transactions they have made from any website

Each transaction sent on Ozric will include a message and a gif to send along with your ethereum :blush:

And of course all of Ozric's transactions are verified with my smart contract, enabling them to appear on the actual block chain and it will stay there for the rest of time for all to see :grin:
